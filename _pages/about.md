Hello, welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a Master's student in Operations Research at [Southwest University](https://www.swu.edu.cn/), where I am luckily advised by the kind [Prof. Jiawei Chen](https://www.scholat.com/jwchen.en). Prior to this, I was a Math AI Training Intern in [Appen Ltd.](https://www.appen.com/). I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics from [Donghua University](https://www.dhu.edu.cn/).

My current research interests are distributed optimization, stochastic optimization, primal-dual algorithms as well as optimiaztion problems arising in machine learning, optimal control and multi-agent decision-making. I am also interested in theory of large language model(LLM), prompt engineering and vibe coding more recently.

Other parts are under construction right now. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
